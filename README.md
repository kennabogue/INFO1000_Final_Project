Final Project - INFO1000

## Final Project

**Description:** Create a personal site in markdown that is hosted on GitHub and provides information about you.

**Purpose:** This project provides experience working with markdown, Git/GitHub, and IT-related concepts and knowledge.

**Requirements:**

This project is to be managed in a public GitHub repository. Submit the Clone with HTTPS URL for the repository that contains the personal site.

The README.md is to serve as the [home page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_page) for your personal site on GitHub. Other markdown pages are to be linked to from the README.md. Provide navigation forward and backward when linking between markdown documents. Also, if useful, create links to navigate within a markdown document.

The information that you present on the markdown pages is up to you. But, it must meet the following requirements. The site must have a minimum of five markdown pages and contain the following somewhere on the pages.

* Paragraphs.
* Headers.
* Links between the markdown pages.
* Links to other web sites.
* One or more images that are hosted in the GitHub repo.
* One or more images that are hosted elsewhere on the web.
* A list.
* Some text that is bolded.
* Some text that is italicized.

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
